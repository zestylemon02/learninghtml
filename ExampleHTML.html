    </p>
    <p>
        <!-- Our tables style is already defined in the CSS document, so we just need to add the Table Rows and Table Data -->
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Lecture</td>
                <td>10-12</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

        We prefer the following definitions of electronic commerce:
    </p>
    <!--  I've defined the style already in CSS and telling the <p> to execute the margin class  -->
    <div class="margin">
        <p>
            <i>Any form of business or administrative transaction or information exchange that is executed using any information
                and communictions teachings....couldn't read the end of it
                <br> - Electronic Commerce Assoication
            </i>
        </p>
    </div>
    <!-- Not sure why they had a blue line there -->
    <hr color="blue" />
    <br>
    <!-- &nbsp means add some whitespace on a non-breaking line, for some reason in the pic it was in this area, could just be a shitty photo -->
    <p>
        Hopefully we can write a better &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp homepage by the end of the semester.
